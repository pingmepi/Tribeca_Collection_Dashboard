Ideal Metrics — Definitions and Calculation Basis

General notes
- All currency values are displayed in ₹ Cr in the UI (amount / 1e7).
- “Per booking” sums use the first value encountered per booking to avoid duplication across milestones when appropriate (e.g., Agreement Value, Corpus + Maintenance).
- “On demand” means rows where Demand Generation Date is present and < today.

Row 1: Property Unit Metrics
- Total units: Number of unique booking IDs in the dataset.
- Total units sold: Unique booking IDs where Booking Date is present.
- Total units unsold: Total units − Total units sold (equivalently, booking date missing).
- Total units registered: Unique booking IDs where Registration Date is present.
- Total units unregistered: Total units − Total units registered.

Row 2: Property Sales Metrics
- Total agreement value: Sum of Agreement Value per booking (first value per booking to avoid duplication).
- Total corpus + maintenance: Sum of Other Charges (Corpus + Maintenance) per booking (first value per booking).
- Total tax: Sum of Tax across all rows (no date filter).
- Total amount: Total agreement value + Total corpus + maintenance + Total tax.

Row 3: Property Demand Metrics
- Total demand generated (without tax): Sum(Amount Due on demand) − Sum(Tax on demand).
- Total tax on demand: Sum(Tax on demand).
- Total corpus + maintenance (on demand): Sum of first Corpus + Maintenance per booking among rows with demand generated (deduped per booking).
- Total due: Sum(Amount Due on demand).

Row 4: Property Collection Metrics
- Total collection: Sum(Payment Received) for rows where Demand Generation Date is present and < today.
- Total tax on collections: Sum(Tax) for rows where Actual Payment Date is present and < today.
- Total collection (without tax): Total collection − Total tax on collections.
- Total collection (without tax & corpus): Total collection (without tax) − Total corpus + maintenance.
  Note: “Total corpus + maintenance” here refers to the per‑booking deduped total from Row 2 (not filtered by dates). If you prefer to base this on demand rows only, use the Row 3 “on demand” corpus value instead.
