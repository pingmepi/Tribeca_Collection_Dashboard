Ideal Metrics — Definitions and Calculation Basis

General notes
- All currency values are displayed in ₹ Cr in the UI (amount / 1e7).
- “Per booking” sums use the first value encountered per booking to avoid duplication across milestones when appropriate (e.g., Agreement Value, Corpus + Maintenance).
- “On demand” means rows where Demand Generation Date is present and < today.

Row 1: Property Unit Metrics
- Total units: Number of unique booking IDs in the dataset.
- Total units sold: Unique booking IDs where Booking Date is present.
- Total units unsold: Total units − Total units sold (equivalently, booking date missing).
- Total units registered: Unique booking IDs where Registration Date is present.
- Total units unregistered: Total units − Total units registered.

Row 2: Property Sales Metrics (3 tiles)
- Total agreement value: Sum of Agreement Value per booking (first value per booking to avoid duplication).
- Total corpus + maintenance: Sum of Other Charges (Corpus + Maintenance) per booking (first value per booking).
- Total amount (Agreement + Corpus): Total agreement value + Total corpus + maintenance. Note: excludes tax.

Row 3: Property Demand Metrics (3 tiles)
- Total demand (without tax): Sum(Amount Due on demand) − Sum(Tax on demand).
- Total tax on demand: Sum(Tax on demand).
- Total due (with tax): Sum(Amount Due on demand).

Row 4: Property Collection Metrics (3 tiles)
- Total collection: Sum(Payment Received) for rows where Demand Generation Date is present and < today.
- % collected from demand due: Total collection ÷ Total due (with tax). If Total due = 0, display 0%.
- Total collection (without corpus): Total collection − Total corpus + maintenance (per‑booking deduped from Sales row).
  Note: If you prefer to base corpus on demand rows only, substitute the "on demand" corpus value accordingly.
